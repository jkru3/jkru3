### Welcome!

My name is Joey, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student currently studying CSE 311 and CSE 351 at the University of Washington. Right now I'm working on a react app called Clear Vote, which you can view as a deployed GitHub page! Currently seeking a programming internship for Spring or Summer. Check out some of my past projects below! If you'd like to collaborate on something together or for any other inquirys, feel free to reach out!
